                    <p>Remembrance is the final project of Dev Bootcamp Chicago students Simon Gondeck, Francisco Scala, Jeremy Wong and Jonathan Young. It is a web application that enables one to create a memorial for a loved one who has passed on. You can invite friends and family to come together here and share memories, whether they be stories or pictures.</p>

                    <p>While seemingly simple, the focus was set on UI/UX due to the sensitive nature of our project. Our proudest accomplishment was the use/integration of a state machine into our project to prevent offensive content online spammers from defacing a memorial.We spent a considerable amount of time writing and implementing an algorithm to filter out hurtful/negative comments.

                    <p>Rembrance was written in Ruby on Rails, Javascript (jQuery), HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. We used Codeship for continuous integration, and stressed heavily on TDD; which resulted in a near 100% test coverage. Our project is entirely open source and can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/JYoung217/memorium"> here.</a></p>
